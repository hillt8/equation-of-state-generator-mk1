Equation of state File Generator (seperate scaling of x y z directions) 

Description: These files are to create the directory path for testing U and Grimme's D3 dispersion using and equations of state method. This will test for values of U 0.0 to 10.0 in increments of 1.0. Will use a scaling factor of 0.01 against the lattice dimensions in the range 0.95 to 1.11.
